### More than one target

All of the previous examples have been about Makefiles that use one or more 
independent targets.

Now let's consider a couple of targets in which some of them play the role
of dependencies for other targets.

In this case we will work with a toy data analysis in R. More specifically,
we will perform a regression analysis on simulated data.



### Toy Regression in R

The code of the analysis is:

```r
# random data
set.seed(754321)
x <- rnorm(20)
y <- x + rnorm(20)

# regression line
reg <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(reg)

# scatter diagram with fitted regression line
plot(x, y, las = 1, pch = 19, col = "#555555")
abline(reg, col = "#0000DD70", lwd = 3)
```

For illustration purposes, the previous code has been split into
three R scripts, each producing an output file:

| `regression-data.R` > `regression.RData`
| `regression-model.R` > `regression-model.md`
| `regression-plot.R` > `scatterplot.png`

You can see the files of this example in the folder `04-dependent-targets/`


### Input and Output files

- `regression-data.R` generates the random vectors, fits the regression
model, and sends the data and the model to a binary file `regression.RData`

- `regression-model.R` reads in the regression data, and then
sends the summary of the regression object to the file `regression-model.md`

- `regression-plot.R` reads in the regression data, and creates a scatter plot
that is saved in the file `scatterplot.png`

- The main output is the file `regression.html` which depends directly on 
`report.md`, and `regression-model.md` 

- The file `report.md`, in turn, uses `scatterplot.png`


### Makefile

Here's the content of the `Makefile`:

```make
all: regression.html

regression.html: report.md regression-model.md scatterplot.png
	pandoc report.md regression-model.md -s -o regression.html

scatterplot.png: regression-plot.R regression.RData
	Rscript regression-plot.R

regression-model.md: regression-model.R regression.RData
	Rscript regression-model.R

regression.RData: regression-data.R
	Rscript regression-data.R
```
