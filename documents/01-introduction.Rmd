### GNU Make

[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), commonly known as __make__,
is a Unix tool that is part of the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/software/).

Make is a "tool which controls the generation of executables and other 
non-source files of a program from the program's source files."

To work with Make you write a text file with the name `Makefile`, 
typically referred to as the _makefile_.

A makefile is formed with __rules__ that have the following structure:

```make
target: dependencies ...
	commands
	...
```

A __rule__ tells Make how to execute a series of commands in order to build
a __target__ file from source files (i.e. the __dependencies__).
Notice that the recipe line(s) must be indented with a TAB and not with any spaces.

Under its most basic form, a rule usually has this structure:

```make
target: dependency
	command
```

For instance, let's say you want to generate an html document `output.html`
from a source markdown file `input.md`, generated with [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/). 
The Make rule in this case would be:

```make
# from markdown to html
output.html: input.md
	pandoc input.md -s -o output.html
```

- the first line is a comment (comments are defined with `#`)

- `output.html` is the target file

- `input.md` is the dependency

- `pandoc input.md -s -o output.html` is the command to build the target


You can have a directory `make-test/` containing the source file `input.md` 
and the makefile `Makefile`:

```
make-test/
	input.md
	Makefile
```

Assuming that you are inside the directory `make-test`, in order to build 
the target file `output.html`, you simply call `make` from the command line:

```bash
make
```

The very first time you run `make`, you should be able to see in the command
line the command that was executed:

```
pandoc input.md -s -o output.html
```

If everything went okay, you should be able to see the generated output file
`output.html`.

Every time you make changes to the input file, you can run `make` again 
to build a new version of `output.html`.

Once `output.html` is built, if you run `make` again---without new changes
made in `input.md`---Make will display a message like this one:

```
make: `output.html' is up to date.
``` 

This indicates that the timestamps of `input.md` and `output.html` are
the same; which means there's nothing new to be built. In other words,
Make will do nothing if nothing needs to be done.

See the files in `01-minimal/` inside the `examples/` folder to 
play with a minimal makefile.
