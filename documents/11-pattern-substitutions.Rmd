### Motivation

Let's consider the example used in the previous two lessons. This involves
executing four R scripts---`script1.R`, `script2.R`, `script3.R`, `script4.R`---
in batch mode via the command `R CMD BATCH --no-save`.


We've seen the naive option of writing a `Makefile` like this:

```make
.PHONY: all clean

all: script1.Rout script2.Rout script3.Rout script4.Rout

script1.Rout: script1.R
	R CMD BATCH --no-save script1.R

script2.Rout: script2.R
	R CMD BATCH --no-save script2.R

script3.Rout: script3.R
	R CMD BATCH --no-save script3.R

script4.Rout: script4.R
	R CMD BATCH --no-save script4.R

clean:
	rm -f *.Rout
```

A makefile like the one above is obviously not very efficient. Instead,
we can define a variable `rcmd` that refers to the R command in each recipe.

Likewise, we can use a pattern rule for all the targets:

```make
%.Rout: %.R
	$(rcmd) $<
```


All the previous elements can be combined in the following makefile:

```make
rcmd = R CMD BATCH --no-save

.PHONY: all clean

all: script1.Rout script2.Rout script3.Rout script4.Rout

%.Rout: %.R
	$(rcmd) $<

clean:
	rm -f *.Rout
```

As you can tell, the only part that still has some repetition has to do
with the prerequisites of the target `all` (i.e. all the `.Rout` files).

It would be nice if you could group all the `.Rout` in one single variable.
Let's see how to do this.


### Using the wildcard function

Remember _Make_'s wildcard function? We can use it to define a variable with
the list of input `.R` files:

```make
rfiles = $(wildcard *.R)
```

The good news is that we have a variable `rfiles` that contains the names
of all the R script files. The problem now is how to take advantage of
`rfiles`?

You may be tempted to do something like this (with some tragic consequences):

```make
rcmd = R CMD BATCH --no-save
rfiles = $(wildcard *.R)

$(rfiles)out: $(rfiles)
	$(rcmd) $(rfiles)
```


### Using Pattern Substitution

To create a variable that contains the name of the `.Rout` files, we are
going to use the function __patsubst__ (for pattern substitution).

The idea is to take advantage of the variable `rfiles`---which has the value:
`script1.R script2.R script3.R script4.R`---and define a __pattern of characters
to be substituted__. 

The function `patsubst` has the following usage:

```
$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)
```

`patsubst` finds whitespace-separated words in `text` that match the 
provided `pattern` and replaces them with the specified `replacement`. 

A `pattern` may contain a `%` which acts as a wildcard, matching any number 
of any characters within a word. If `replacement` also contains a `%`, 
the `%` is replaced by the text that matched the `%` in `pattern`. 
Only the first `%` in the pattern and replacement is treated this way; 
any subsequent `%` is unchanged.

In our example, we can use `patsubst` to create the variable `rout` like thi:

```make
rfiles = $(wildcard *.R)

rout = $(patsubst %.R,%.Rout,$(rfiles))
```

- `%.R` is the pattern to be match in the provided _text_

- `$(rfiles)` is the provided _text_ (i.e. `script1.R script2.R script3.R script4.R`)

- `%.Rout` is the replacement


In other words, `patsubst` will look for the pattern `.R` in `rfiles`,
and will replace the pattern with `.Rout`. This implies that `rout` will
be a text formed by: `script1.Rout script2.Rout script3.Rout script4.Rout`.

Having obtained the variable `rout` with the list of output files, we can 
complete the `Makefile` as follows:

```make
rcmd = R CMD BATCH --no-save
rfiles = $(wildcard *.R)

rout = $(patsubst %.R,%.Rout,$(rfiles))

all: $(rout)

%.Rout: %.R
	$(rcmd) $<

clean:
	rm -f *.Rout
```

Note that the variable `rout` is used as the prerequisite of the target `all`.
You don't need to write a long list of prequisites for `all`.
