### Files in several directories

The examples covered so far have all the input and output files located in
one single directory. But this is rarely how most real projects are 
structured.

In this lesson, we are going to discuss a toy example of an "article" about 
the [R project](https://www.r-project.org/). All the directories and files
are in the example folder `05-file-system/` which has the following structure:

~~~
05-file-system/
	Makefile
	sections/
		01-intro.md
		02-environment.md
		03-logo.md
	images/
		Rlogo-old.png
		Rlogo-new.png
~~~

The idea is to generate an html file `R-project.html` (containing some text 
about the R project), that is built with the `.md` files in `sections/`.

To make things a bit more interesting, the generated output file will be placed 
at the level of the parent directory (i.e. `05-file-system/`)


### Generating the html document

To generate the output `R-project.html` file from the 3 `.md` files, you would
have to `cd` into `sections/` and then run __pandoc__ like so:

```bash
pandoc *.md -s -o R-project.html
```


But remember that we want `R-project.html` to be at the parent level. Assuming
that you are inside `sections/`, you would need to `mv` the output file
`R-project.html` one level up:

```bash
mv R-project.html ../
```


### The Makefile

How do you tell Make to switch between sub-directories and move files to 
different locations? Very easy: using shell commands to navigate the file 
system.

Here's how the `Makefile` looks like:

```make
all: R-project.html

R-project.html: sections/01-intro.md sections/02-environment.md sections/03-logo.md
	cd sections; pandoc *.md -s -o R-project.html
	cd sections; mv R-project.html ../
```

Important things to keep in mind: the `Makefile` lives at the top level.
All dependencies are in the `sections/` sub-directory.

- `R-project.html` is the target file

- The dependencies are the markdown files inside the `sections/` folder

- The recipe involves two commands:
	+ first we `cd` into `sections/` and then call `pandoc`
	+ then we `cd` again into `sections/` and `mv` the target file one level up

All the commands for each rule have as a starting point the location where
the `Makefile` is. This is why we need to `cd` into `sections/` in order to
run pandoc. 

Note the use of the semicolon in the command:

```bash
cd sections; pandoc *.md -s -o R-project.html
```

the semicolon lets us group several related instructions in one single line.


### Relative paths of image files

There is one last important detail that we need to mention. As you can tell 
from the file structure, there is an `images/` folder. This is where the
PNG files of the R logos are located.

Those logos are used inside the file `03-logo.md`. If you take a look at this
file, you will see a couple of lines like these:

```
### Old and New Logos

![R old logo](images/Rlogo-old.png)

### New Logo

![R new logo](images/Rlogo-new.png)
```

Pay attention to the path names of each image file. They are paths relative 
to the location of `R-project.html`. The output file is located at the
top level, and this is exactly where `images/` is located too. In this way
`R-project.html` can load correctly the R logos.
