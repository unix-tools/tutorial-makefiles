### Motivation

Let's go back to the first example in `01-minimal/` where we have one single 
source file `input.md` that `pandoc` converts into the html file `output.html`:

```make
# from markdown to html
output.html: input.md
	pandoc input.md -s -o output.html
```

The makefile contains one rule with one target file, one dependency, and a 
recipe formed by one command.

This is a very simple example but it serves perfectly to illustrate the use of 
a special type of _Make_ variables called __automatic variables__.

Notice that the string `output.html` appears in both the target, and also in 
the command of the recipe. Likewise, the string `input.md` appears in the
prerequisite as well as in the command of the recipe.

To saving typing and start avoiding repetition, _Make_ provides a handful of 
special variables that you can use in a recipe. Here's how we can rewrite the 
rule in a more compact---but cryptic---way:

```make
# from markdown to html
output.html: input.md
	pandoc $< -s -o $@
```

__What is happening?__. We replaced `input.md` with the variable `$<`, and 
`output.html` with the variable `$@`. These weird looking variables have the
following meanings:

- `$<` is the automatic variable whose value is the name of the first prerequisite.

- `$@` is the automatic variable whose value is the name of the target.



### Automatic Variables

Automatic variables are variables that can only be used within the recipe. These
variables have values computed afresh for each rule that is executed, based on 
the target and prerequisites of the rule. 

Because they are variables, they all start with the dollar symbol `$` followed
by another character. Here's a list with some of the most common types of 
automatic variables:

- `$@` the file name of the __target__

- `$%` the target member name

- `$<` the name of the __first prerequisite__

- `$?` the names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target

- `$^` the names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.

As mentioned in _Make_ manual, you cannot use automatic variables "anywhere 
within the target list of a rule; they have no value there and will expand to 
the empty string."



### Example

Let's check the `Makefile` of `04-dependent-targets/`. In this example we
create an html report of a regression analysis in R. There is one main target 
`regression.html` that depends on a series of prerequisite files:

```make
all: regression.html

regression.html: report.md regression-model.md scatterplot.png
	pandoc report.md regression-model.md -s -o regression.html

scatterplot.png: regression-plot.R regression.RData
	Rscript regression-plot.R

regression-model.md: regression-model.R regression.RData
	Rscript regression-model.R

regression.RData: regression-data.R
	Rscript regression-data.R
```

How can we use automatic variables in this case? We can use `$<` to replace
the name of the first prerequisite in most rules. We can also use `$@` in the
rule that generates the html file. To make things more interesting, we can 
also create a variable `reg` that takes the string "regression":

```make
reg = regression

all: $(reg).html

$(reg).html: report.md $(reg)-model.md scatterplot.png
	pandoc report.md $(reg)-model.md -s -o $@

scatterplot.png: $(reg)-plot.R $(reg).RData
	Rscript $<

$(reg)-model.md: $(reg)-model.R $(reg).RData
	Rscript $<

$(reg).RData: $(reg)-data.R
	Rscript $<
```
