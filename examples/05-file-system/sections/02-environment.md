## The R environment

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, 
calculation and graphical display. It includes:

- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data 
analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen 
or on hardcopy, and
- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes 
conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output 
facilities.

The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned 
and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and
inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.
